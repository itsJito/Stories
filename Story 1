STORY
	Humbles Tavern.

X Prologue

The year was 1888. Wyoming, the last bastion of the Wild West, was in turmoil. Towns were springing up as fast as the railroads could lay track, bringing with them corruption, vice, and opportunism. Meanwhile, news of a fearsome blizzard spread like wildfire, its looming threat sending shivers down the spines of every man, woman, and child in the territory. What they didn't know was that this blizzard would trap some of the most notorious characters of the time in one place.

Enter Henry Humble's Tavern, a rustic saloon nestled between towering mountains and open plains. The wooden sign creaked in the wind, bearing the face of a stern man - that was Henry Humble, the proprietor. He was polishing a glass when the door burst open.

"Damn cold out there," grumbled John "The Hangman" Ruth, shaking the snow from his coat. A burly man with a large scar running down his face, Ruth was feared as the most ruthless bounty hunter in the West.

Henry looked up and nodded. "Worse is to come, they say."

Ruth sat at the bar and scanned the other patrons. His eyes landed on Lenny Freemason - a young, defiant African-American man trying his best to keep a low profile.

From the shadows came the voice of Dutch Van der Linde, a hint of mockery in his tone, "Mr. Ruth! To what do we owe this pleasure?"

Dutch's gang was notorious, and he was its charismatic leader. Nearby, Arthur Morgan and John Marston stood alert. They were Dutch's right-hand men, each with tales of ruthlessness attached to their names.

Then the door swung open again, letting in a flurry of snow and a tall figure. It was John Turner, known throughout the territory as the Lone Gunslinger, a man whose reputation preceded him.

As Turner took a seat, Ruth pointed to Lenny, "That boy has a thousand dollar bounty on his head, says he's stolen more horses than any man alive.

Lenny stood up immediately, "I've been wronged! These charges are false! I've been branded a thief by those who cannot bear to see a black man free!"

Marston whispered to Morgan, "We could use a horse thief in our ranks."

Dutch, ever the instigator, chimed in, "Mr. Ruth, maybe you should consider that not everything is black and white. The system is rigged and Lenny may be its latest victim."

Ruth scoffed, "I don't care about your philosophies, Dutch. I care about the money. That boy is my ticket."

As the tension grew, Henry slammed a glass down on the bar. "Enough! This is my tavern, and I will have no bloodshed here. We're all trapped in this blizzard and we'd better find a way to get along."

Dutch grinned, "I agree, Mr. Humble. Let's have a drink. We'll work out our differences tomorrow."

Turner added in a deep voice, "Sounds good to me. It's too damn cold out there to fight anyway."

Night fell, but the storm showed no signs of abating. Snow piled up against the windows and the wind howled like a wolf. Inside Humble's Tavern, the atmosphere was electric. Every glance, every whispered conversation was charged with the potential for violence.

Amidst the tense atmosphere, Ruth and Lenny played a game of poker, Dutch plotted with his gang, and Turner sat back and watched the drama unfold.

As they all sat, drinks in hand, stories began to flow, revealing dark secrets, past betrayals, and raw ambition. The night became a battle of wits, with each man trying to gain the upper hand.

X	Chapter 1: A Melting Pot of Motives

Inside the candlelit tavern, shadows played on the wooden walls, dancing with each flicker. John "The Hangman" Ruth, still watching Lenny Freemason like a hawk watching a mouse, leaned over to him and said, "You know, boy, turning you in would be a feather in my cap. $1,000 can go a long way."

Before Lenny could reply, a strong hand was on Ruth's shoulder. It was Arthur Morgan, his blue eyes cold as ice, "Ruth, we're all stuck here. You might want to think twice before you start trouble you can't finish."

Ruth, known to be fearless, met Arthur's gaze, but seemed to read something in the other man's eyes that made him back down. He grunted and let go of Lenny, but his intent was clear. The storm outside might be the only thing that saved the young man tonight.

Across the room, Dutch, a master manipulator, approached Lenny with a charming smile, "Lenny, my boy. Such a price on your head at such a young age. You have talent. Have you ever thought of using it for a real purpose? We could give you opportunities, even a family."

Lenny, cautious but willing to listen, replied, "I'm not looking for a new gang, Dutch. I just want to clear my name. I never stole those horses."

Dutch nodded, "Innocent or not, the world is not kind to men like us. But together we can change the story."

As Dutch and Lenny talked, John Marston, Turner, and Ruth gathered around a table, turner pouring a shot of whiskey. With the initial tensions simmering for the moment, the stories began to flow, each man trying to outdo the other.

"I remember the standoff at Broken Bridge," Marston began, "taking out fifteen men single-handed."

Turner grinned and sipped his drink, "Try getting ambushed in Rattlesnake Valley. Twenty against one, and I walked away."

Ruth laughed, "You boys and your stories. Ever face the Crowder gang in an open field? That was something."

As they swapped stories, the atmosphere in the tavern lightened for a moment, making everyone forget about the storm outside. That was until the door burst open, bringing in a swirl of snow and revealing a silhouette. It was Jesse Belle, her raven hair wild, her eyes fierce. A rancher's daughter turned outlaw after her father's suspicious death. She was known to be ruthless, as dangerous as any man in the room.

"Damn storm won't let up," she panted, brushing off the snow, "Mind if I join you?"

Before anyone could object, Marston, sensing the gravity of the situation outside, helped her barricade the door with a long wooden beam. "This should keep the cold out," he murmured.

With the door sealed, they were truly trapped. John Ruth, perhaps in an attempt to establish some semblance of civility, began grinding coffee beans. "Nothing like a hot cup to warm the bones," he remarked.

Henry Humble, ever the gracious host despite the unique situation, began to prepare a large pot. "If we're all going to be guests here for a few days, we might as well have a decent meal." He began to cook the stew, the savory aroma quickly filling the room.

The scene was surreal: Ruth making coffee; Henry at the stove; Dutch whispering promises of better days to Lenny; Arthur, Marston, and Turner still telling tales of the past; and now Jesse, a wild card in the mix, looking over each of them, calculating.

As the stew simmered and the coffee brewed, it became clear that while the storm outside was fierce, the one inside was unpredictable and potentially far more deadly. Each person in that room had a story, an ambition, a plan. Only time would tell how their paths would intersect.

X 	Chapter 2: Dividing Lines and Unlikely Bonds

The warmth of the tavern was in stark contrast to the storm raging outside, but tensions were far from cooled. Ruth, proud of his brewing skills, handed Jesse Belle a cup of his coffee. She took a sip and pulled her face back in disgust before spitting it out, exclaiming, "It tastes like horse shit!"

John Ruth, never one to let an insult slide, stood up sharply and pointed a finger at Jesse. "You impertinent brat! You wouldn't know good coffee if it bit you in the ass!"

Jesse's eyes flashed back, "Maybe if you spent less time chasing bounties and more time learning how to brew, you'd make something drinkable!"

Tempers flared as the two moved closer, eyes locked in a venomous stare. It was clear that blows would soon follow. The room buzzed with activity; Marston and Turner moved to restrain Ruth, while Arthur and Dutch tried to calm Jesse.

Dutch, always one to see opportunity in chaos, raised his hand for silence. "All right! Enough of this. This room is big enough for everyone. Let's divide it up. The south side for my gang and allies," he gestured to the side where he, Arthur, Marston and Lenny sat. "And the north side for everyone else."

Turner laughed, "Neutral table, huh? A truce over stew?"

Dutch smiled wryly, "Even in war there are rules. Mutual territories. Besides, Mr. Humble's stew deserves our respect."

Henry, trying to defuse the tension, announced, "Speaking of which, the stew is ready! Let's not let it get cold."

As they all gathered around the table, the earlier hostilities seemed to temporarily disappear, replaced by the universal language of hunger. The rich aroma of the stew filled the room, reminding them of simpler times.

Dutch, surveying the unique gathering, began to speak, his voice carrying an infectious warmth. "Look at us, a room filled with different souls, different pasts, but tonight, brought together by fate and this storm. It's a reminder that no matter what our differences, there's something bigger than all of us. This storm, this world. We may come from different sides, but tonight let's forget that and remember that we're all human, sharing a meal."

The room fell silent, everyone lost in Dutch's words. Then, at a moment no one expected, Ruth murmured, "Amen to that.

Dutch, looking surprised, turned to him, "I never pegged you for the approving type, Ruth."

Ruth chuckled, "There's a first time for everything. Speaking of which, remember that woman in El Paso with the chestnut mare? Finest combination of beauty and beast I ever saw."

Dutch roared with laughter, "Ah, Ruth, I remember. You always had an eye for women and horses. Preferably together."

They continued to share memories, the atmosphere in the room lightening as the two former adversaries found common ground.

But as laughter filled the room, Lenny and Jesse quietly excused themselves and slipped away unnoticed. The two exchanged glances, sharing a mutual understanding that it was one to be kept away from the prying eyes and ears of the others.

The tavern continued to buzz with chatter, but outside the blizzard raged on, a stark reminder that the real storm might not be the one outside, but the one brewing within.

X 	Chapter 3: Bloody Brews

In a dim corner of the tavern, away from prying eyes, Lenny and Jesse huddled together. Their whispers together were as cold as the snowflakes outside. "He took my father from me," Jesse hissed, her eyes dark with pain. "And I'll be damned if I'm going to let him leave this place."

Lenny, clearly disturbed but understanding, said, "I'll help you with Ruth, but the others, they're off limits."

Jesse nodded, "Agreed."

Lenny, seeing an opportunity, returned to the main table and sought out Dutch, his walk purposeful. "Dutch," he began, trying to keep his voice steady, "what if I told you there's a way for us both to benefit? I've reconsidered your offer. But I have my terms."

Before Dutch could respond, John Ruth, visibly agitated by Lenny's presence, sneered, "Making deals, are we? Remember your place, horse thief!" he snorted with contempt, "Do you really think he'd trust the likes of you?"

Lenny's eyes hardened, "It's not about trust. It's about opportunity."

"You've got some nerve, boy," he spat, his anger boiling. He slammed his fist down on the table, "You're still a wanted man, and I still plan on taking you in, Freemason!" He stormed off to the bar.

At the bar, as John Ruth set about making another pot, Henry polished glasses, his movements rhythmic and calming. Ruth, seeking distraction, remarked, "You ever read the Good Book, Henry?"

Henry looked up, surprised. "Been a while. My ma used to read from it every Sunday."

Ruth's eyes softened, memories flooding back. "Mine, too. Simpler times. Faith and family."

Henry smiled gently, "A mother's love and the word of God. Strong anchors in this chaotic world."

"You know," Henry began, looking thoughtful, "my mother always said that coffee was God's way of giving us a second chance every morning."

Ruth smiled, "Mine said the same thing. She said each morning was a new page in God's book."

Henry chuckled, "Sounds like something my own mother would say." He paused, looking distant. "She'd recite the Psalms while she made breakfast. Had a way of making the mundane seem sacred."

Ruth nodded, "There's magic in those moments, isn't there? Mothers have a way of making memories out of the ordinary."

As the two men continued their conversation, they found common ground in the cherished memories of their mothers. Laughter and reminiscing drew them closer, two rugged souls bonding over the women who'd shaped them.

Meanwhile, the somber mood of the tavern was pierced by a sudden note from the piano. Turner, fingers gliding over the keys, began a lively melody that seemed to beckon everyone. As if by magic, the room was transformed. People began clapping, laughing, and dancing. The tavern came alive, a world away from the cold storm outside.

Arthur and Dutch, dropping their usual seriousness, engaged in a hilarious mock duel, using spoons as swords, much to everyone's amusement. Lenny and Jesse attempted a dance, but with every turn and twist, they kept stepping on each other's feet, leading to uproarious laughter. And when Arthur tried to sing, his voice was so off-key that even the most somber couldn't help but laugh.

In another corner, Turner challenged Dutch to a jig. Dutch, always one for theatrics, exaggerated every move and had everyone cheering and laughing. Not to be outdone, Lenny showed off some dance moves of his own, much to the amusement of the crowd.

But as the laughter echoed and joy reigned, no one noticed Jesse, with a mischievous smile, discreetly pouring a vial of liquid into the freshly brewed coffee. The dark beverage swallowed the deadly poison, its aroma masking any foul intent.

When John finished his dance, he poured Ruth and Marston a cup each. "Coffee?" he offered to the others, but they all shook their heads, bottles and glasses already in hand.

Arthur, raising an eyebrow, teased, "Trading whiskey for coffee? Going soft on us?"

Marston smiled wryly, "Got a family to think of, Arthur. Can't always drown my sorrows."

Just as the celebration reached its climax, Marston's face turned pale. He clutched his stomach, his eyes wide with alarm. The room fell silent as he stood frozen, the music from the piano abruptly ceasing. A minute seemed like an eternity, the only sound the soft ticking of a clock and the wind outside.

Then, in a horrifying spectacle, Marston spat blood violently, it splattered across the floor, the crimson stark against the wooden floorboards. Gasping for breath, he rasped, "I... I don't feel..." Marston's voice trailed off as he crumpled to the floor, convulsing, his eyes searching desperately for Arthur and Dutch.

"John! Stay with us!" Arthur shouted, the desperation evident in his voice.

The two men rushed to his side, disbelief and panic on their faces. "Johnny!" Arthur cried, cradling his friend's head. Dutch, always the leader, barked orders, "Somebody get water! NOW!" 

Marston, gasping for air, managed to whisper, "For my family..." before his eyes rolled back and he fell lifeless into Arthur's arms.

The room was in chaos. Turner had stopped playing, the last notes of the piano echoing eerily. But before anyone could process Marston's sudden demise, Ruth felt a burning sensation and clutched his stomach, his face contorted in agony. He staggered, turned toward the door, but stopped in his tracks as he vomited blood violently. He tried to speak, but his voice was muffled by the sound of a thick gargle. 

As the room reeled, trying to comprehend the twin tragedies unfolding before them, Ruth's eyes, filled with dawning realization and terror, locked on Jesse's. She stood apart, a malevolent smile playing on her lips. Before anyone could react, she drew her revolver and shot Ruth through the eye with deadly precision. The thud of his body echoed ominously in the silence that followed.

Jesse's laughter, a chilling contrast to the scene, filled the room. The tavern, once filled with joy and music, had become a scene of horror and betrayal. The blizzard outside raged on, but the storm inside had taken an even darker turn. The chapter ends with the collective gasp of the room, the weight of betrayal and the looming unknown bearing down on them all.

X 	Chapter 4: Deciept

Arthur's face smoked with rage as he lunged at Jesse with the speed of a cheetah and before she could react, his boot connected with her face, sending her flying. As she tried to regain her footing, he was on her again, landing a solid blow to her jaw. The force of the blow sent her reeling into the corner, her vision blurred.

"Enough of this!" Arthur roared, turning the dining table over, his voice echoing through the room. He turned his attention to Henry, Lenny, and Jesse. "All of you, empty your pockets! Every gun, and knife. And DON'T think I won't check for hidden ones. Throw them in the bucket! NOW!"

The three complied, fear in their eyes. The sound of metal against metal filled the room as they dropped their weapons.

With a menacing glare, Arthur began to recount the events of the past few hours, his voice dripping with venom. "You all want to know what I have seen? What I witnessed? John, lying there, lifeless. And all of you, with your secrets and your lies."

Jesse, her face bloodied, tried to interject, but Arthur silenced her with a glare. "Not your turn yet."

Dutch, his face a mask of grief, sat in the background, cradling Marston's lifeless body, his sobs echoing through the room.

Arthur's gaze fell on Jesse, his eyes narrowing. "You! You shot Ruth! Did you think we wouldn't find out? That makes you the prime suspect in John's death."

Jesse, her face bloodied but defiant, met his gaze. "Yes, I shot Ruth. That bastard had my father hanged! He was an innocent man! I only wanted to poison Ruth, not Marston, he just had to drink the same coffee!"

The room fell silent, the weight of her confession hanging in the air. But before anyone could react, Dutch, with a look of pure rage, shoved Arthur aside. Without a word, he raised his shotgun and fired, the deafening blast echoing through the room as Jesse's lifeless body slumped to the floor, her brains splattered against the wall.

Henry's screams pierced the air, his face a mask of horror. "You monster! You killed her!"

Dutch, his face cold and unfeeling, turned to Henry. "She confessed to poisoning John. She got what she deserved."

Lenny, tears streaming down his face, trying to find some semblance of peace, tried to approach Marston's body, but Dutch's voice stopped him. "You! You think you can mourn him? After you conspired with her?"

Lenny, shocked, could only stammer, "Dutch, I..." he stammered. "Dutch, I had nothing to do with it!"

But Dutch wasn't listening. With a quick movement, he had Lenny at gunpoint, his finger twitching on the trigger.

The room was silent, the tension palpable. Every eye was on Dutch, waiting for his next move.

X 	Chapter 5: Solace in Snow

Lenny's eyes darted around the room, searching for an escape, a way out of this nightmare. His heart was pounding and sweat was dripping down his brow. "Dutch," he began, his voice shaking, "I swear on my mother's grave, I had nothing to do with this."

Dutch, his face contorted with rage, pressed the cold barrel of the gun against Lenny's temple. "You think I'd believe you? After everything?"

Lenny, his eyes wide with fear, stared at Dutch, the barrel of the shotgun cold. "Dutch, listen to me," he pleaded, his voice shaking. "I knew she was going to kill Ruth, but I swear on my mother's grave I didn't know how. I didn't know she'd poison John. I thought she'd challenge him to a duel or something, not this... not this treachery. If you don't believe me, take me in! Take my bounty! Use it for the gang!"

Dutch's face twitched, a hint of doubt creeping into his eyes. He lowered the shotgun slightly, but the threat was still there. "You think your life is worth this bounty?"

Lenny nodded vigorously. "Yes, Dutch. If it means you believe me, take me in. But please don't kill me here."

The room was silent for a moment, the only sound being the howling wind outside and the crackling of the fireplace. Arthur, his face still contorted with rage, broke the silence. "We must decide what to do with him."

Henry, his face pale, spoke up. "We can't just execute him without proof."

Arthur's eyes flashed. "Proof? His confession wasn't proof enough for you?"

Lenny's eyes darted between the men, hope and fear warring within him. "Please, just let me explain."

Dutch held up a hand, silencing him. "Enough. We'll put it to a vote. All in favor of executing Lenny, raise your hand."

Arthur, Turner and Dutch all raised their hands. Henry was undecided. Lenny's heart sank. Dutch, his face impassive, looked at Lenny. "Three to one, Lenny."

Before Lenny could react, Dutch raised his shotgun and fired. The deafening blast echoed through the room and Lenny's body crumpled to the floor, blood pooling around him.

The room was silent for a moment, the weight of what had just happened sinking in. Arthur, his face grim, spoke. "We have to clean this up. We can't leave two bodies here."

Dutch nodded, his face pale. "I'll get the shovels. We'll bury them out back."

The men set to work, the grim task made more difficult by the howling storm outside. The wind whipped snow into their faces, stinging their eyes and making it hard to see. But they persevered, digging two shallow graves in the frozen ground.

As they worked, Dutch's mind raced. The events of the past few hours weighed heavily on him. The loss of John, the betrayal of Jesse, and now the execution of Lenny. He wondered if he had made the right decision, if there was another way. But he pushed those thoughts aside. He had to stay strong for the gang.

Hours later, the men trudged back into the cabin, their faces red and raw from the cold. They gathered around the fireplace, the warmth of the flames a stark contrast to the cold reality of their situation.

Dutch, his face drawn and tired, spoke up. "We'll wait out the storm here. Once it's passed, we'll move on. We can't stay here any longer."

The men nodded in agreement, the weight of the day's events heavy on their minds. They settled in, the flickering flames casting dancing shadows on the walls, the only sound being the howling wind outside.

As the night wore on, the storm intensified, the wind howling like a banshee, the snow piling up outside. But inside the cabin, there was a sense of camaraderie, of brotherhood. Despite the tragedy and betrayal, the gang was still together, still strong.

And as the first rays of dawn broke through the storm clouds, Dutch knew that they would survive, that they would move on, that the storm would pass, and that they would find solace in the snow.

X 	Chapter 6: Thawing Tensions

The morning sun began to break through the thick clouds, casting a golden glow over the snow-covered landscape. As the snow slowly began to melt, patches of green grass began to appear, signaling the arrival of spring. After spending the night in the cabin, the gang decided it was time to move on.

Dutch led the way, with Arthur, John Turner, and Henry close behind. The sound of hooves crunching on the melting snow filled the air as they made their way toward town. The journey was quiet, each man lost in his own thoughts, reflecting on the events of the past few days.

As they approached the town, they could see the townspeople going about their daily routines, children playing in the streets, and merchants setting up their stalls. The town seemed untouched by the chaos that had unfolded in the cabin.

Dutch, always the leader, decided they should split up to avoid attracting attention. "Arthur, you and Turner go to the saloon and gather some information. Henry, you and I will restock our supplies."

The men nodded in agreement and went their separate ways. Arthur and Turner entered the saloon, the familiar sound of piano music and chatter filling their ears. They took a seat at the bar and ordered a couple of drinks. As they sipped their whiskey, they heard whispers about a new sheriff in town, known for his no-nonsense approach and determination to rid the town of outlaws.

Meanwhile, Dutch and Henry went to the general store for supplies. As they were leaving, a wanted poster caught Dutch's eye. It was a sketch of him with a large bounty on his head. He quickly pulled down his hat to cover his face and ushered Henry out of the store.

Back at the saloon, Arthur and Turner were approached by a mysterious stranger. "You two new in town?" he asked, eyeing them suspiciously.

"Just passing through," Arthur replied, trying to keep his composure.

The stranger nodded, "Well, be careful. The new sheriff doesn't take kindly to strangers."

With that warning, the stranger left, leaving Arthur and Turner uneasy. They quickly finished their drinks and left to regroup with Dutch and Henry.

The four men met on the outskirts of town and shared what they had learned. "We need to lay low," Dutch said, "this new sheriff sounds like trouble."

They decided to set up camp in a secluded area, away from prying eyes. As night fell, they sat around a campfire, telling stories and trying to forget the horrors of the past few days.

But as the snow continued to melt, a chilling discovery was made. The bodies of Jesse and Lenny, which had been hastily buried, began to rise from their shallow graves. A local farmer stumbled upon them and quickly alerted the sheriff.

The news spread like wildfire, and the town was abuzz with rumor and speculation. The new sheriff, determined to solve the mystery, began his investigation.

As the group sat around their campfire, they heard the distant sound of horses approaching. They quickly doused the fire and hid in the shadows, watching as a group of lawmen rode by, heading for the cabin.

The realization hit them hard. The law was on their trail, and it was only a matter of time before they were caught.

To be continued...
