Prologue: The Sasquatch Siege

In a world much like ours, where the lands stretched with bountiful forests and the horizon met with shimmering seas, a cataclysm struck, the likes of which no storyteller or historian had ever penned. The year was 1214, a year that would go down in infamy in the annals of time. A year when humanity would be brought to its knees, not by their own hand but by creatures of legend.

From the deepest and darkest woods, and the highest, chilliest mountain peaks, they came. Sasquatches and Yetis: towering titans, humanoid in shape but far from human in nature. Their sizes ranged wildly, the smallest being imposing at three meters, and the most mammoth stretching to a colossal sixteen meters. Their fur-covered forms cast gigantic shadows on the lands they trampled, and their roars echoed across continents.

The world plunged into chaos. Kingdoms that once stood tall and unyielding crumbled under their weight. Armies, powerful and fierce, fell before them like mere toys. Cities were reduced to rubble, and countrysides were flattened. Hope was but a flicker, threatened by a gust of despair.

Amidst the devastation, a beacon of hope arose. King Troy, a monarch of unmatched valor and intelligence, recognized the need for unity and survival. With unwavering determination, he envisioned a fortress: three mammoth walls to stand as the last bastion against the ever-looming Sasquatch threat. Each wall bore a name, poetic in its simplicity: Wall George, Wall Viola, and Wall Elizabeth.

As these walls rose, so too did the spirits of the beleaguered masses. Thousands flocked under the protection of King Troy, and within the embrace of these walls, a semblance of society began to reform. But with this new refuge came a delineation, both physical and social. The walls, while a sanctuary, also manifested as barriers of class and privilege.

Wall George, the outermost, was a relentless reminder of the world they'd lost. Here, the peasants, survivors of the initial onslaught, scratched out a living. Danger was but a stone's throw away, with the Sasquatch’s shadows often playing tricks on the residents’ minds.

Wall Viola represented progress. Craftsmen and merchants set up shop, and life began to show hues of normalcy. Yet, the residents of Viola always harbored aspirations, for beyond them lay Wall Elizabeth.

The innermost haven, Wall Elizabeth, was a realm of splendor and security. Here, amidst grand palaces and lush gardens, the nobility, and the elite found respite. King Troy's palace, a marvel of architecture, stood tall, overlooking his kingdom of walls. Beside him, a Parliament of wise men and women, worked tirelessly, shaping the future of this last bastion of humanity.

But with such disparity came the need for order. King Troy, ever the strategist, devised a three-pronged military structure. The Military Police, stalwarts of the law, patrolled the streets and alleyways, ensuring that order reigned supreme. The Rangers, brave men and women, stood guard on the walls, their eyes forever scanning the horizon, weapons at the ready. But perhaps the bravest of them all were the Scouts. They were the adventurers, the risk-takers. Venturing beyond the walls, they faced the Sasquatch threat head-on, gathering intelligence and scouting paths for potential, future liberation.

And so, behind these walls, humanity held its breath, teetering on the edge of hope and despair. Little did they know, the real stories, the tales of heroism, love, treachery, and unimaginable horrors, were yet to unfold.

For in the shadowy world of R.L. Stein, where every corner hides a secret and every whisper tells a tale, the saga of the Sasquatch Siege was only just beginning.

Chapter 1: The Siege of Serenity

A century had passed since the walls were erected, and the tales of the monstrous Sasquatches and Yetis had turned into bedtime stories; stories to scare little children into obedience. The memories of their terror were faded, nestled safely behind the thick, towering walls. It was a time of peace, prosperity, and unbridled hope. But, as the saying goes, all good things come to an end.

One chilling evening, the very earth trembled. A mighty roar, one that hadn't been heard in generations, echoed throughout the realm. Before anyone could comprehend what was happening, an enormous shadow loomed over Wall George. It was a Sasquatch, but not like any they had seen or heard of. Towering at a staggering twenty meters, it was devoid of any fur, its naked skin exposed, making it look more grotesque than its furry counterparts. With one powerful swing, it smashed a gaping hole in the northern side of Wall George.

Panic ensued. King Arthur, the present monarch and descendant of King Troy, swiftly declared the region unsafe, enacting an immediate lockdown. But the damage was done. One hundred thousand souls were lost that day, their screams still echoing in the wind. An exodus began. The residents of Wall George, about a million of them, flooded into Wall Viola seeking refuge. With Wall Viola's population already at 750,000, the influx presented immense social and economic challenges.

Housing became the foremost issue. Makeshift shelters sprouted around Wall Viola, leading to cramped and unsanitary living conditions. The existing infrastructure, from sewage systems to water supply, was stretched thin, leading to frequent outbreaks of diseases. Economically, the sudden surge in population led to inflation, as resources became scarce and demand skyrocketed. The previous social order was disrupted, as newcomers struggled to find their place in an already established community.

Recognizing the gravity of the situation, King Arthur, in a bold move, launched Operation George. Assembling a force of 120,000 Rangers, the cream of his military, he sought to reclaim Wall George. What followed was a gruesome battle, the likes of which hadn't been seen since the first Sasquatch Siege. The Rangers faced insurmountable odds, and after days of intense combat, they emerged victorious but at a terrible cost. Seventy-five thousand brave souls laid down their lives, and Wall George was won back, not by sheer might, but with the strategic use of cannon fire, suppressing the Sasquatch hordes long enough to erect a temporary blockade.

A decade passed before Wall George was fully reconstructed. However, the scars of that dreadful day remained. The northern side, which bore the brunt of the Sasquatch's wrath, became known as "the ghetto." It was a stark reminder of the fragility of peace and the price of war. The once bustling and vibrant part of the city now stood in stark contrast to the rest, its buildings bearing the marks of the assault, its streets echoing with the whispers of the past.

Among the many who witnessed the aftermath of Operation George was a young boy named Justin Turner. At ten, he stood on the streets of Wall Viola, watching the Rangers return. Their expressions spoke volumes. The grief, the anguish of losing comrades, was evident in their eyes. The sight left an indelible mark on young Justin. The horrors of war were laid bare before him, but instead of fear, it instilled in him a resolve. A resolve to be one of those brave souls, to defend his people, and to ensure that the horrors he witnessed would never be repeated.

Thus, in the shadow of devastation, a new flame was kindled, and Justin's journey to become a Ranger had just begun.

Chapter 2: Secrets and Resolutions

Justin, Eren, and Maya walked home, their footsteps echoing in the empty streets of Wall Viola. The evening sky was painted in hues of orange and pink, casting long shadows as the three friends trudged along.

"I still can't believe what we saw," Justin whispered, still shaken by the sight of the returning Rangers.

Eren's eyes sparkled with determination. "We should join them, Justin. We could make a difference!"

Maya, looking concerned, interjected, "Eren, it's dangerous! Did you not see their faces? The pain, the grief?"

Eren squeezed her hand gently. "I know, Maya. But it's our home, our future. We need to defend it."

Justin looked lost in thought, processing what he'd just seen and what Eren was suggesting. "I'm thinking about it," he finally admitted.

They arrived at Justin's home, a modest brick building nestled amidst a row of similar houses. Martha, Justin's mother, was in the kitchen, preparing supper. The aroma of freshly baked bread wafted through the air.

Before Justin could even open his mouth, Eren burst out, "Aunt Martha! We're thinking of joining the Rangers!"

Martha's face went pale. She put down the knife she was holding, her hands trembling. "You're what?"

Maya, sensing the tension, said, "Eren! You shouldn't have!"

But Justin stepped forward, his voice firm. "Mom, I want to be a Ranger. After what we saw today, I feel it's the right thing to do."

Martha's eyes brimmed with tears. "No! Absolutely not! It's too dangerous. I won't have my only son marching to his death!"

As the room filled with tension, the front door opened, revealing Albert, Justin's father. Wearing his blacksmith apron, he paused, sensing the palpable tension. "What's going on here?"

Eren, ever the impulsive one, blurted out, "We want to join the Rangers, Uncle Albert."

Albert's gaze met Martha's. There was a silent exchange, years of shared experiences communicated in mere seconds. He then turned to Justin, "Come with me."

Martha's voice cracked, "Albert, no! We can't let him."

Albert raised a hand, silencing her. "Not now, Martha. I'll talk to him." He then whispered something in her ear, the tension in her face easing slightly.

Eren and Maya stood awkwardly, realizing that they should probably leave. "We'll see you tomorrow, Justin," Maya said softly, giving him a reassuring smile.

Eren added, "Think about it, okay? We could be heroes."

After they left, Albert turned to Justin, "After work, meet me in the cellar. There's something you should see."

Justin nodded, curious and hopeful.

Albert headed out, leaving Martha and Justin in silence. After a moment, Martha's voice broke the stillness, "Go clean your room, Justin. And think about what you're asking for."

With a heavy heart, Justin made his way upstairs. As he began tidying up, he couldn’t help but wonder what secret his father held in the cellar and whether it would change the trajectory of his life forever.

Chapter 3: Rising Shadows

The evening sun cast a brilliant glow across Varrock, its golden rays shimmering off the vast walls. But beneath its majestic facade, the city was grappling with shadows that were growing darker each day.

La Ordinem, an insidious crime syndicate, was spreading its tentacles deep into the heart of the city. Led by the cunning and ruthless Tony Mussolini, they had their hands in every illicit business one could think of. Their operations spanned from loan sharking, where they lent money at exorbitant rates and then used brutal force to collect, to money laundering, turning their ill-gotten gains into seemingly 'clean' wealth. Their most feared tactic was their extortion and protection rackets. Businesses were forced to pay La Ordinem for 'protection', and those who refused faced destruction.

Despite their growing influence, La Ordinem remained mostly underground, a whispered fear in the dark alleys of Varrock. That was until they brazenly attacked a stagecoach carrying crucial medical supplies for the hospitals. It wasn’t the loss of supplies that shook the city; it was the audacity of the act. For the first time, King Arthur became truly aware of the serpent lurking beneath his kingdom.

Infuriated by this blatant act of defiance, King Arthur convened an emergency council. Recognizing the complexity of the issue and in need of expert advice, he swore in the brilliant strategist, Dr. Levi Mantra, as his royal advisor. Together, they devised a plan to track down and eradicate La Ordinem from Varrock.

However, just four days later, as King Arthur journeyed to a crucial meeting with the governor of Wall Viola, tragedy struck. His stagecoach was ambushed. Despite the valiant efforts of his guards, King Arthur was slain, sending shockwaves throughout Varrock.

As the city mourned, Marcus, King Arthur’s younger brother, was ceremoniously sworn in as King. His coronation was not one of joy but of resolve. Addressing the grieving populace, King Marcus delivered a speech that would be etched into the annals of history:

"People of Varrock, we stand at a crossroads. The shadows of La Ordinem seek to engulf our great city. But we will not cower. We will rise, and we will eradicate this menace. I swear upon my life and the memory of my dear brother that I will put a stop to their reign of terror. But beyond this darkness, I envision a new dawn, a new beginning. Ten miles from our beloved Varrock, we will lay the foundation for a new kingdom - Lumbridge. A symbol of our resilience and hope. And when the time is right, I will pass on the crown of Varrock to a worthy successor while leading Lumbridge into a golden era. But until then, stand with me, for we have battles to win and a future to secure."

The populace, although grieving, felt a spark of hope listening to King Marcus. They believed in his vision and his resolve.

However, the shadows were far from defeated. As night fell, Albert, the hardworking blacksmith and father to young Justin, made his way home from work, his mind preoccupied with the secret he was to share with his son. As he traversed a dimly lit alley, a group of shadowy figures surrounded him. Before he could react, they relieved him of his belongings. And as he tried to resist, a blade flashed, snuffing out another life in Varrock.

Albert never made it home. And the secret of the cellar remained buried with him.
