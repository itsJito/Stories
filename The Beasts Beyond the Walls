Prologue

Once, the land known now as Ireland, was a realm of unending beauty and thriving life. Its rolling hills and lush meadows were the envy of lands afar. The folk who dwelled within its bountiful embrace knew peace, and the simple joys that the morrow brought. Yet, beneath the veil of tranquility, a storm was brewing in the wilderness beyond, a storm that would shatter the calm and cast a long, dark shadow across the land.
The year 1250 brought the chill of death upon the warm breath of spring. From the icy wastes emerged beings of legend and dread—Yetis and Sasquatches. Towering over trees, their fur matted with the frozen blood of their prey, they roamed the land with a wrathful hunger. Their eyes, cold as the northern wastes, saw through the hearts of men, women, and children. The horror of their onslaught left nothing but ashes in their wake, every shred of hope crushed under their monstrous tread.
The cries of despair echoed through the realm, as the earth ran red. The world of men crumbled like autumn leaves under the wrath of winter. Yet, in the ashes of despair, ember of hope still glowed. The desperate souls of the island banded together, their wills hardened by the harrowing nightmare that danced in the shadows of the night.
Under the leadership of King Leonidas, a beacon of hope in a world plunging into darkness, a grand design took form—the construction of the Four Square Walls. Stone by stone, with the blood and sweat of the weary but unbroken populace, the walls rose against the gray skies. By the year 1252, the first outer wall pierced the heavens, a silent guardian over the tears of the land. As the shadows grew long, so did the resolve of the people and the towering walls that encircled them. The final stone was placed in the year 1255, and a kingdom of survivors flourished in the heart of the sanctuary.
Yet, within the cold embrace of the stone barriers, the world of men was reborn in the image of the past. King Leonidas sat upon the throne, his gaze fixed upon the walls that shielded them from the horrors beyond, yet cast a long, dark shadow upon the hearts of his subjects. Under his rule, the kingdom was a mirror to medieval England, its reflection marred by the scars of the past.
The nobles, adorned in silks and satins, reveled in the glory of the King's favor, their lands vast, their coffers filled with the fruits of the commoner's toil. They were the sword and the shield of the realm, their allegiance to the throne their claim to power.
The knights, gallant in their shining armor, were the martial might of the kingdom, their lives pledged to the sword. Their valor was a shining beacon in the gloom, yet their eyes were ever turned towards the stone barriers that penned them in.
Lawmen, the hand of justice, moved amongst the populace, their word the law, their judgments feared and revered. They were the keepers of order, the chain that bound the society to the will of the King.
Commoners, the heart and soul of the realm, toiled from dawn till dusk, their labors the lifeblood that sustained the kingdom. Their dreams were simple, their desires humble, yet the walls that promised them protection were also the bars of a cage that held them captive.
Peasants, the lowest rung in the ladder of hierarchy, lived a life of hardship and toil. Their hands bore the callouses of unending labor, their backs bent but unbroken under the weight of nobility's demands.
As the years turned into decades, the terror that once roamed the land turned to legends told in hushed whispers under the pale moonlight. Yet, the scars ran deep, the memories etched into the very soul of the realm. The walls stood tall, their cold stone a constant reminder of the dread that lurked beyond, the world within bound to the past, its gaze turned inwards, afraid to look beyond the horrors that once were, towards the promise of what could be.

Chapter 1: The Shadows of the Giants

In the kingdom of Varrok, time seemed to have frozen in the year of 1255 when the walls were named. Wall George, the outermost barrier, stood as a grim testament to the courage and fears of the people. It was named after a valorous king whose legacy was marred by the relentless attacks of the giants during its construction. The inner walls, Wall William and Wall Mary, embraced the kingdom's heart with a tighter grip, their stones resonating with the whispers of hope and dread alike. At the core lay Wall Elizabeth, the mightiest of them all, enveloping the sanctum of nobility and the King's palace, a world apart from the toils and fears of the commoners.
The society within Varrok had begun to breathe a sigh of relief, the horrors of the past slowly fading into the veil of time. But the calm was shattered in 1260 when the giants returned with a wrath unparalleled. As the sun set, casting long shadows on Wall George, the earth trembled under the march of the colossal beings. Their fury descended upon the wall, the sky filled with cries of despair as stone crumbled and blood painted the earth red. Thousands perished under the merciless onslaught, their screams echoing through the hearts of those within the inner walls.
King Leonidas, his heart heavy with the weight of the crown, declared Wall George unsafe. His decree sent waves of panic through Varrok as millions sought refuge behind Wall William. The exodus was a sorrowful march of fear and hope, the roads filled with an endless stream of humanity, clutching onto the fragments of their shattered lives. The nobles, from their high towers in Wall Elizabeth, watched as the realm trembled under the shadow of fear.
The sudden influx of refugees within Wall William strained the resources to a breaking point. The prices of basic necessities soared, leaving the commoners and peasants to fight for scraps. The nobles, ensconced in their secure enclave, remained indifferent to the plight of the masses, their lives untouched by the pain that gripped the realm.
The streets of Varrok, once filled with laughter, now echoed with cries of despair. The scars of the attack were etched deep into the soul of the kingdom. The walls that once symbolized hope now stood as grim reminders of the fragile veil that separated Varrok from annihilation.
In the wake of the horror, King Leonidas acted with a resolve that echoed through the annals of Varrok. Three months post the attack, he formed the King's Military, a formidable force to safeguard the realm. It branched into three—The Military Police, tasked with maintaining order within the walls; The Rangers, the sword that would defend the barriers; and The Scouts, the eyes and ears that would venture into the unknown, seeking knowledge to fight the shadows beyond.
Alongside, the King envisioned a beacon of hope through knowledge. He established Varrok Science and Research (VSAR), entrusting it with the sacred duty of unraveling the mysteries of the giants. At its helm, he placed Albert Levi, a mind brilliant and unyielding. Levi’s eyes, always alight with the flame of curiosity, bore the hope and fears of Varrok as he delved into the abyss of the unknown.
In the quiet dawn, King Leonidas found himself walking through the hushed corridors of Varrok Science and Research, his steps echoing through the vast halls of knowledge. The air was thick with the scent of old books and fresh parchment, mingling with the sharp tang of chemicals. It was a realm of inquiry, where minds delved into the mysteries that plagued Varrok.
At the heart of this sanctum sat Dr. Albert Levi, a man whose reputation resonated through the kingdom. His eyes, a deep well of intellect and curiosity, looked beyond the veil of the known, seeking answers in the shadows that danced on the frontier of understanding.
The King's steps led him to the doors of Dr. Levi's chamber. As the door swung open, a rush of cool, sterile air greeted him. Dr. Levi, surrounded by a realm of vials and parchments, looked up from his microscope, his eyes meeting those of the King.
"Your Majesty," he said, rising to his feet with a slight bow. His voice was calm, the resonance of intellect vibrating through the silence.
"Dr. Levi," King Leonidas acknowledged, his voice carrying the weight of the crown and the hopes of Varrok. "I have long heard of your endeavors into the unknown. Your mind seeks beyond the veil, a quality rare and precious."
Dr. Levi merely nodded, humility etched in his stance.
The King continued, "The shadow of the giants looms over Varrok. The walls hold, but for how long? We need more than stone to protect us. We need knowledge, the kind that can unveil the mysteries of the giants, to find a way to secure our realm."
Dr. Levi listened, the gravity of the King's words sinking in. The King took a breath before he continued, "I’ve followed your works, Dr. Levi, your inquiries into the nature of the unknown, your undying thirst for truth. Varrok needs a mind like yours, to pierce through the darkness that encircles us.”
Dr. Levi’s eyes met the King’s, the flame of determination mirrored in both.
"I have witnessed the despair in the eyes of our people,” the King’s voice trembled with emotion. “The walls, they stand tall, but the fear... it seeps through the cracks. I believe you hold the key to the answers Varrok seeks, Dr. Levi. You see beyond the fear, beyond the unknown.”
Dr. Levi felt the weight of the King's words, the hopes of a kingdom laid before him.
"I am honored, Your Majesty,” Dr. Levi said, his voice steady. “The journey to unravel the mysteries of the giants is fraught with peril. But the promise of a dawn free from fear, it's a pursuit worthy of every peril.”
King Leonidas nodded, the first rays of the morning sun casting a glow on the kingdom that stood under the veil of hope and despair. In the silence of the dawn, an alliance was forged, one that carried the promise of a future where the shadows of the giants would be dispelled by the light of knowledge.

Chapter 2: The Rise of Lumbridge

A century had flowed past like the rivers through the veins of Varrok, each day carving deeper into the legacy of King Leonidas. The island had nurtured generations under the towering vigil of the walls, and the memory of the giants faded into tales whispered under the warmth of hearth fires. The Scouts, brave souls donned in the cloak of valor, ventured time and again into the realm beyond, yet every expedition was met with the cold embrace of the unknown, their courage ambushed under the veil of the wilderness. The furthest any had ventured was a mere 60 kilometers before being swallowed by the shadows.
The throne of Varrok saw the ascension of kings and queens, each carrying the legacy of Leonidas, their eyes beholding the walls with the memory of the ancient terror. Yet, as the suns rose and set, painting skies with the hues of time, the gaze of the crown turned inwards. The threats of the outer world seemed distant as the pulse of Varrok beat with the rhythm of internal dreams and challenges.
The year 1360 saw the reign of King Adolf, a visionary whose eyes bore into the future with a dream to expand the glory of Varrok. He saw beyond the stone encasement, his mind painting visions of a realm that stretched beyond the grasp of fear. He envisioned a twin kingdom, a realm that would stand parallel to Varrok, sharing its legacy yet carving its own destiny.
Under the decree of King Adolf, the land to the east stirred with the promise of a new dawn. Common folk, peasants whose lives were mere whispers under the towering nobility, found their hands shaping the destiny of the realm. They toiled under the sun and stars, their sweat and blood giving birth to Lumbridge, a kingdom that rose 25 kilometers to the east of Varrok.
The construction of Lumbridge was not merely a test of mortal strength but a celebration of human spirit. The materials were chosen with meticulous care, the foundations laid with a blend of ancient wisdom and newfound knowledge. Each stone that rose into the sky carried the hopes of countless souls, the walls echoing with the laughter and cries of the generations to come.
The decade saw Lumbridge growing from a mere whisper into a roar that echoed through the lands. By 1370, the gates of Lumbridge opened to unveil a realm that mirrored the glory of Varrok yet bore its own signature. The stones were stronger, the walls a testament to the unyielding spirit that had birthed it.
King Adolf, with the heart of a pioneer, sought to dwell in the new realm he had fathered. He saw Lumbridge as a symbol of hope, a haven that bore the mark of the future. Yet, the throne of Varrok could not be left to whispers. With a heart laden with dreams and hopes, he bestowed the crown of Varrok upon Queen Rose, a soul whose wisdom and grace echoed through the hearts of the folk.
Queen Rose ascended to the throne with the blessings of King Adolf, her eyes beholding the legacy of Varrok with a blend of reverence and the promise of a new dawn. The realm now stood with twin crowns, Varrok and Lumbridge, realms born of the same root, yet branching into destinies of their own.
The transition of power was a tide that carried the hopes of the folk, their eyes beholding the dawn of a new era. The nobility, though stirred by the winds of change, found their roots entrenched in the soil of traditions, their allegiance shifting with the tides of time.
As Lumbridge flourished under the gaze of King Adolf, Varrok nestled under the gentle reign of Queen Rose. The realm was a blend of the old and new, the traditions entwined with the hopes of tomorrow.
Yet, amidst the days of peace, the ancient tales of the giants whispered through the lands, a memory that lurked in the shadows. The walls of Varrok and Lumbridge stood tall, yet the eyes that beheld them bore the ancient question – what lurked beyond the veil of the unknown? Each stone carried the legacy of the past, the shadows of the giants a cold whisper against the warm blood of hope that flowed through the veins of the twin kingdoms.
The centuries had carved deep into the heart of the realm, yet the mystery that danced beyond the walls remained veiled, the silence a haunting melody that echoed through the hearts of the brave. And as the sun cast long shadows on the land, the pulse of the unknown beat against the walls, a rhythm that carried the ancient call of the wilderness.
As the sun cast long shadows on the land of Varrok, the rhythm of life echoed through its stone-paved streets and towering walls. The morning sun brought with it the bustling of merchants setting up their stalls, the clattering of horseshoes on cobblestones, and the rich aroma of baked bread wafting through the air. The heart of Varrok beat with the elegance of tradition, its pulse resonating through the delicate artistry of its architecture, the enduring bond of community, and the reverence for the crown.
In Varrok, the veil of mist that cradled the dawn bore witness to the diligent craftsmen, the skilled blacksmiths, and the gentle hands that wove dreams into fabric. The traditions were a tapestry of time, each thread carrying tales of yore. The days unfurled with the tolling of bells, the prayers whispered in the ancient chapels, and the lively chatter in the market squares. As the sun cast its golden glow, the nobility adorned in silks and velvets, graced the halls of power, their discourse shaping the destiny of Varrok.
Amidst the sea of Varrok's age-old traditions, Lumbridge bloomed with a charm distinct yet intertwined with the roots that birthed it. The essence of Lumbridge was a dance of grace, its rhythm an ode to the finer nuances of life. The morning in Lumbridge was a canvas painted with the hues of blooming flowers, the melody of lutes, and the delicate aroma of pastries.
Life in Lumbridge was an art, each moment curated with a gentle touch. The streets resonated with the laughter of children, the cheer of gatherings in quaint cafes, and the serene hum of evening vespers. The nobility of Lumbridge reveled in the art of conversation, their evenings a celebration of culture, the wine a companion to the melodies that serenaded the stars.
King Adolf, with dreams that soared beyond the confines of walls, envisioned a realm that bore the promise of fresh dawn. A decade post the birth of Lumbridge, his eyes set upon the land that stretched beyond. With a vision that resonated through the heart of Lumbridge and Varrok, he embarked on a journey to birth a third realm, a kingdom that would stand as a testament to the unyielding spirit of exploration.
The hands that had once shaped Lumbridge now reached beyond, their toil and dreams giving birth to Salem. As the stones of Salem rose against the sky, the realm bore the mark of a new horizon. King Adolf, with a heart brimming with hopes, took the throne of Salem, his gaze beholding the dance of destiny that had led him from Varrok to Lumbridge, and now to Salem.
In Lumbridge, the reins of destiny were handed over to King Phillip, a soul whose wisdom was a guiding star in the realms of change. His reign carried the essence of the land, a blend of tradition and the hope of new horizons.
Salem, under the vigilant eyes of King Adolf, blossomed into a realm where tradition and innovation danced in a harmonious ballet. The mornings in Salem were a hymn of discipline, the days a canvas of industrious dreams, and the nights a veil of peaceful rest under the starlit skies.
Over two decades, Salem embraced traditions that resonated with the rhythm of precision, the celebration of craftsmanship, and the reverence for the lore that bound the realms together. The heartbeat of Salem was a tune of meticulous artistry, its pulse a blend of the past and the visions of the days to come.
The triad of kingdoms, Varrok, Lumbridge, and Salem, now stood as a testament to the indomitable spirit that had once envisioned a realm free from the shackles of fear. The walls that had once whispered tales of dread now echoed with the tales of realms that had risen against the tides of time, each bearing the legacy of the past, yet each carving a destiny of its own under the endless skies.
