Prologue: The Sasquatch Siege

In a world much like ours, where the lands stretched with bountiful forests and the horizon met with shimmering seas, a cataclysm struck, the likes of which no storyteller or historian had ever penned. The year was 1214, a year that would go down in infamy in the annals of time. A year when humanity would be brought to its knees, not by their own hand but by creatures of legend.

From the deepest and darkest woods, and the highest, chilliest mountain peaks, they came. Sasquatches and Yetis: towering titans, humanoid in shape but far from human in nature. Their sizes ranged wildly, the smallest being imposing at three meters, and the most mammoth stretching to a colossal sixteen meters. Their fur-covered forms cast gigantic shadows on the lands they trampled, and their roars echoed across continents.

The world plunged into chaos. Kingdoms that once stood tall and unyielding crumbled under their weight. Armies, powerful and fierce, fell before them like mere toys. Cities were reduced to rubble, and countrysides were flattened. Hope was but a flicker, threatened by a gust of despair.

Amidst the devastation, a beacon of hope arose. King Troy, a monarch of unmatched valor and intelligence, recognized the need for unity and survival. With unwavering determination, he envisioned a fortress: three mammoth walls to stand as the last bastion against the ever-looming Sasquatch threat. Each wall bore a name, poetic in its simplicity: Wall George, Wall Viola, and Wall Elizabeth.

As these walls rose, so too did the spirits of the beleaguered masses. Thousands flocked under the protection of King Troy, and within the embrace of these walls, a semblance of society began to reform. But with this new refuge came a delineation, both physical and social. The walls, while a sanctuary, also manifested as barriers of class and privilege.

Wall George, the outermost, was a relentless reminder of the world they'd lost. Here, the peasants, survivors of the initial onslaught, scratched out a living. Danger was but a stone's throw away, with the Sasquatch’s shadows often playing tricks on the residents’ minds.

Wall Viola represented progress. Craftsmen and merchants set up shop, and life began to show hues of normalcy. Yet, the residents of Viola always harbored aspirations, for beyond them lay Wall Elizabeth.

The innermost haven, Wall Elizabeth, was a realm of splendor and security. Here, amidst grand palaces and lush gardens, the nobility, and the elite found respite. King Troy's palace, a marvel of architecture, stood tall, overlooking his kingdom of walls. Beside him, a Parliament of wise men and women, worked tirelessly, shaping the future of this last bastion of humanity.

But with such disparity came the need for order. King Troy, ever the strategist, devised a three-pronged military structure. The Military Police, stalwarts of the law, patrolled the streets and alleyways, ensuring that order reigned supreme. The Rangers, brave men and women, stood guard on the walls, their eyes forever scanning the horizon, weapons at the ready. But perhaps the bravest of them all were the Scouts. They were the adventurers, the risk-takers. Venturing beyond the walls, they faced the Sasquatch threat head-on, gathering intelligence and scouting paths for potential, future liberation.

And so, behind these walls, humanity held its breath, teetering on the edge of hope and despair. Little did they know, the real stories, the tales of heroism, love, treachery, and unimaginable horrors, were yet to unfold.

For in the shadowy world of R.L. Stein, where every corner hides a secret and every whisper tells a tale, the saga of the Sasquatch Siege was only just beginning.

Chapter 1: The Siege of Serenity

A century had passed since the walls were erected, and the tales of the monstrous Sasquatches and Yetis had turned into bedtime stories; stories to scare little children into obedience. The memories of their terror were faded, nestled safely behind the thick, towering walls. It was a time of peace, prosperity, and unbridled hope. But, as the saying goes, all good things come to an end.

One chilling evening, the very earth trembled. A mighty roar, one that hadn't been heard in generations, echoed throughout the realm. Before anyone could comprehend what was happening, an enormous shadow loomed over Wall George. It was a Sasquatch, but not like any they had seen or heard of. Towering at a staggering twenty meters, it was devoid of any fur, its naked skin exposed, making it look more grotesque than its furry counterparts. With one powerful swing, it smashed a gaping hole in the northern side of Wall George.

Panic ensued. King Arthur, the present monarch and descendant of King Troy, swiftly declared the region unsafe, enacting an immediate lockdown. But the damage was done. One hundred thousand souls were lost that day, their screams still echoing in the wind. An exodus began. The residents of Wall George, about a million of them, flooded into Wall Viola seeking refuge. With Wall Viola's population already at 750,000, the influx presented immense social and economic challenges.

Housing became the foremost issue. Makeshift shelters sprouted around Wall Viola, leading to cramped and unsanitary living conditions. The existing infrastructure, from sewage systems to water supply, was stretched thin, leading to frequent outbreaks of diseases. Economically, the sudden surge in population led to inflation, as resources became scarce and demand skyrocketed. The previous social order was disrupted, as newcomers struggled to find their place in an already established community.

Recognizing the gravity of the situation, King Arthur, in a bold move, launched Operation George. Assembling a force of 120,000 Rangers, the cream of his military, he sought to reclaim Wall George. What followed was a gruesome battle, the likes of which hadn't been seen since the first Sasquatch Siege. The Rangers faced insurmountable odds, and after days of intense combat, they emerged victorious but at a terrible cost. Seventy-five thousand brave souls laid down their lives, and Wall George was won back, not by sheer might, but with the strategic use of cannon fire, suppressing the Sasquatch hordes long enough to erect a temporary blockade.

A decade passed before Wall George was fully reconstructed. However, the scars of that dreadful day remained. The northern side, which bore the brunt of the Sasquatch's wrath, became known as "the ghetto." It was a stark reminder of the fragility of peace and the price of war. The once bustling and vibrant part of the city now stood in stark contrast to the rest, its buildings bearing the marks of the assault, its streets echoing with the whispers of the past.

Among the many who witnessed the aftermath of Operation George was a young boy named Justin Turner. At ten, he stood on the streets of Wall Viola, watching the Rangers return. Their expressions spoke volumes. The grief, the anguish of losing comrades, was evident in their eyes. The sight left an indelible mark on young Justin. The horrors of war were laid bare before him, but instead of fear, it instilled in him a resolve. A resolve to be one of those brave souls, to defend his people, and to ensure that the horrors he witnessed would never be repeated.

Thus, in the shadow of devastation, a new flame was kindled, and Justin's journey to become a Ranger had just begun.

Chapter 2: Secrets and Resolutions

Justin, Eren, and Maya walked home, their footsteps echoing in the empty streets of Wall Viola. The evening sky was painted in hues of orange and pink, casting long shadows as the three friends trudged along.

"I still can't believe what we saw," Justin whispered, still shaken by the sight of the returning Rangers.

Eren's eyes sparkled with determination. "We should join them, Justin. We could make a difference!"

Maya, looking concerned, interjected, "Eren, it's dangerous! Did you not see their faces? The pain, the grief?"

Eren squeezed her hand gently. "I know, Maya. But it's our home, our future. We need to defend it."

Justin looked lost in thought, processing what he'd just seen and what Eren was suggesting. "I'm thinking about it," he finally admitted.

They arrived at Justin's home, a modest brick building nestled amidst a row of similar houses. Martha, Justin's mother, was in the kitchen, preparing supper. The aroma of freshly baked bread wafted through the air.

Before Justin could even open his mouth, Eren burst out, "Aunt Martha! We're thinking of joining the Rangers!"

Martha's face went pale. She put down the knife she was holding, her hands trembling. "You're what?"

Maya, sensing the tension, said, "Eren! You shouldn't have!"

But Justin stepped forward, his voice firm. "Mom, I want to be a Ranger. After what we saw today, I feel it's the right thing to do."

Martha's eyes brimmed with tears. "No! Absolutely not! It's too dangerous. I won't have my only son marching to his death!"

As the room filled with tension, the front door opened, revealing Albert, Justin's father. Wearing his blacksmith apron, he paused, sensing the palpable tension. "What's going on here?"

Eren, ever the impulsive one, blurted out, "We want to join the Rangers, Uncle Albert."

Albert's gaze met Martha's. There was a silent exchange, years of shared experiences communicated in mere seconds. He then turned to Justin, "Come with me."

Martha's voice cracked, "Albert, no! We can't let him."

Albert raised a hand, silencing her. "Not now, Martha. I'll talk to him." He then whispered something in her ear, the tension in her face easing slightly.

Eren and Maya stood awkwardly, realizing that they should probably leave. "We'll see you tomorrow, Justin," Maya said softly, giving him a reassuring smile.

Eren added, "Think about it, okay? We could be heroes."

After they left, Albert turned to Justin, "After work, meet me in the cellar. There's something you should see."

Justin nodded, curious and hopeful.

Albert headed out, leaving Martha and Justin in silence. After a moment, Martha's voice broke the stillness, "Go clean your room, Justin. And think about what you're asking for."

With a heavy heart, Justin made his way upstairs. As he began tidying up, he couldn’t help but wonder what secret his father held in the cellar and whether it would change the trajectory of his life forever.

Chapter 3: Rising Shadows

The evening sun cast a brilliant glow across Varrock, its golden rays shimmering off the vast walls. But beneath its majestic facade, the city was grappling with shadows that were growing darker each day.

La Ordinem, an insidious crime syndicate, was spreading its tentacles deep into the heart of the city. Led by the cunning and ruthless Tony Mussolini, they had their hands in every illicit business one could think of. Their operations spanned from loan sharking, where they lent money at exorbitant rates and then used brutal force to collect, to money laundering, turning their ill-gotten gains into seemingly 'clean' wealth. Their most feared tactic was their extortion and protection rackets. Businesses were forced to pay La Ordinem for 'protection', and those who refused faced destruction.

Despite their growing influence, La Ordinem remained mostly underground, a whispered fear in the dark alleys of Varrock. That was until they brazenly attacked a stagecoach carrying crucial medical supplies for the hospitals. It wasn’t the loss of supplies that shook the city; it was the audacity of the act. For the first time, King Arthur became truly aware of the serpent lurking beneath his kingdom.

Infuriated by this blatant act of defiance, King Arthur convened an emergency council. Recognizing the complexity of the issue and in need of expert advice, he swore in the brilliant strategist, Dr. Levi Mantra, as his royal advisor. Together, they devised a plan to track down and eradicate La Ordinem from Varrock.

However, just four days later, as King Arthur journeyed to a crucial meeting with the governor of Wall Viola, tragedy struck. His stagecoach was ambushed. Despite the valiant efforts of his guards, King Arthur was slain, sending shockwaves throughout Varrock.

As the city mourned, Marcus, King Arthur’s younger brother, was ceremoniously sworn in as King. His coronation was not one of joy but of resolve. Addressing the grieving populace, King Marcus delivered a speech that would be etched into the annals of history:

"People of Varrock, we stand at a crossroads. The shadows of La Ordinem seek to engulf our great city. But we will not cower. We will rise, and we will eradicate this menace. I swear upon my life and the memory of my dear brother that I will put a stop to their reign of terror. But beyond this darkness, I envision a new dawn, a new beginning. Ten miles from our beloved Varrock, we will lay the foundation for a new kingdom - Lumbridge. A symbol of our resilience and hope. And when the time is right, I will pass on the crown of Varrock to a worthy successor while leading Lumbridge into a golden era. But until then, stand with me, for we have battles to win and a future to secure."

The populace, although grieving, felt a spark of hope listening to King Marcus. They believed in his vision and his resolve.

However, the shadows were far from defeated. As night fell, Albert, the hardworking blacksmith and father to young Justin, made his way home from work, his mind preoccupied with the secret he was to share with his son. As he traversed a dimly lit alley, a group of shadowy figures surrounded him. Before he could react, they relieved him of his belongings. And as he tried to resist, a blade flashed, snuffing out another life in Varrock.

Albert never made it home. And the secret of the cellar remained buried with him.

Chapter 4: Whispers of Varrock

The sun had barely risen, but the streets of Varrock were already alive with hushed whispers. The news of Albert's death had spread like wildfire, and a crowd had gathered in the alley where his body was discovered. The cobblestones, usually a dull gray, were stained a dark crimson, a stark reminder of the tragedy that had occurred.

Justin, with a heavy heart and a mind filled with worry, ventured out in search of his father. 

As he wandered the streets, he noticed a gathering crowd in a narrow alleyway. His heart raced as he pushed through, and the sight that met him was one he would never forget.

Albert's lifeless body lay on the cobblestones, a pool of crimson surrounding him. The stark contrast of the blood against the gray stones was a chilling sight. Justin's legs felt weak, and he stumbled forward, reaching out to touch his father's hand. It was cold, so cold, a stark reminder of the life that had been snuffed out.

Martha, having followed Justin, saw him and rushed forward, pulling him into a tight embrace. Tears streamed down her face as she tried to shield her son from the horror. But the pain was too raw, too real. The two of them clung to each other, seeking solace in their shared grief.

Kenny, the local lawman with a mane of blonde hair and a beard that seemed to have a life of its own, approached the grieving family. His voice was gentle, yet firm, "Martha, Justin, come with me. This is no place for you." He offered to arrange the funeral services and escorted them home, protecting them from the prying eyes of the crowd.

News of Albert's death spread like wildfire. By evening, their home was filled with mourners. The raw emotions were palpable. Justin's grief was juxtaposed with a burning anger, a desire for vengeance. "I'll find who did this," he vowed, clenching his fists.

Martha, her eyes red from crying, snapped, "Enough, Justin! Your anger won't bring him back. We need to grieve, not seek revenge." she said sharply. Kenny had the funeral arranged within hours. The funeral was a testament to Albert's legacy. As the most renowned blacksmith in Varrock, the entire community came out to pay their respects. Stories of his kindness, his dedication to his craft, and his love for his family filled the air. Even King Marcus himself attended, offering his condolences to the Turners and promising justice.

The funeral was held in the heart of Varrock, under the shade of an ancient oak tree. The entire community had gathered, their faces a mix of sorrow and respect for the renowned blacksmith, Albert.

Justin stood beside the grave, his eyes red and swollen. He clenched his fists, trying to hold back the tears. "My father was not just a blacksmith. He was a pillar of this community, a loving husband, and the best father anyone could ask for," he said, his voice choked with emotion. "I loved him so much"

Martha, draped in a black shawl, stepped forward, placing a hand on Justin's shoulder. "Albert loved this town, and he loved all of you. He believed in the goodness of people, in hard work, and in the power of community. I ask you all to remember him for the love he gave and the lives he touched."

Kenny, the blonde-haired lawman, cleared his throat, "Albert was a man of honor. I've known him since we were kids, playing in these very streets. He had a heart of gold and hands that could forge the toughest metals. Varrock has lost one of its finest."

A murmur of agreement rippled through the crowd. Many nodded, wiping away tears, remembering their own interactions with the kind-hearted blacksmith.

King Marcus, dressed in regal attire, stepped forward. "Albert Turner was not just a citizen of Varrock; he was its soul. His contributions to this community are immeasurable. I promise you, Martha, Justin, justice will be served."

Justin looked up, his eyes filled with a mix of grief and determination. "Thank you, Your Majesty. My father believed in justice, and I trust that his death will not be in vain."

Martha, trying to hold back her tears, whispered to Justin, "Your father would be so proud of you."

Justin's desire to become a Ranger was evident, and when he expressed it, King Marcus saluted him. "Your father would be proud," he said, much to Martha's chagrin. But the King's words of encouragement and his invitation to the upcoming coronation were a balm to Justin's wounded soul.

The city of Varrock was on edge. The lawlessness that had claimed Albert's life was a growing concern. The streets saw increased patrols, curfews were imposed, and a community watch was formed. But for Justin, the path was clear. He would honor his father's memory, not just by forging metal, but by forging a legacy of justice.

The grand hall of Varrock in Wall Elizabeth was a sight to behold. Banners adorned the walls, and golden ornaments reflected the light, creating a spectacle of grandeur. As the nobles and scholars gathered, murmurs filled the air. Dr. Mantra's scholarly background was well-known, and his appointment as the new king was met with a mix of excitement and uncertainty.

A brief flashback took the audience to a time when Dr. Mantra was engrossed in his studies, surrounded by books and scrolls. His dedication to knowledge was evident, and it was this very dedication that King Marcus believed would lead Varrock to a brighter future. King Marcus coronates him via sword, and hands him his crown. "For Gloria!" the pair exclaim, welcomed by a standing ovation.

1320. The sun rose over the horizon, casting a golden hue on the newly constructed city of Lumbridge. Like Varrock, it was secured by a series of walls, but in an an octogon shape. The walls were named Wall Troy, Wall Levi, Wall Arthur and Wall Marcus from outermost to innermost. Nestled by the river, the city was a testament to the architectural brilliance of the era, a symbol of progress and innovation. The town's architecture was a blend of old-world charm and modern innovation. Stone cottages with thatched roofs stood alongside grand manors, their spires reaching for the sky. The River Lum, which meandered through the town, was spanned by several ornate bridges, each a marvel of engineering.

The town's main square was always bustling. Market stalls were laden with fresh produce, cheeses, and meats. The aroma of freshly baked bread wafted through the air, drawing people to the local bakeries. Street performers played traditional tunes, their melodies reminiscent of ancient ballads and sea shanties. The townsfolk, with their crisp and distinct accent, would often engage in friendly banter, discussing the weather or the latest news from Varrock.

Varrock, on the other hand, exuded an air of sophistication and grandeur. Its streets were lined with elegant townhouses and grand boulevards. Cafés dotted every corner, where intellectuals and artists would gather, sipping on fine wines and discussing philosophy and art. The Varrockian accent was softer, more melodic, a stark contrast to the sharp tones of Lumbridge.

The differences between Lumbridge and Varrock were not just linguistic. In Lumbridge, traditional dances were held in the town square, where men and women would link arms and dance in circles, their steps in perfect harmony. Varrock, with its love for the arts, hosted grand operas and theatre performances, drawing crowds from all over.

Fashion too was distinct. Lumbridge's attire was practical yet elegant. Men wore tailored suits, often paired with waistcoats and hats, while women donned flowing dresses with intricate lacework. In Varrock, fashion was avant-garde. Men sported colorful cravats and breeches, and women wore dresses with elaborate ruffles and high collars.

The technological advancements in Lumbridge were evident in its infrastructure. Advanced pulley systems and cranes were used in construction, and the introduction of water mills and windmills revolutionized industries. These mills, often set against the backdrop of the serene River Lum, were used for various purposes, from grinding grain to pumping water.

King Marcus and Mantra, recognizing the potential of collaboration, worked closely to develop advanced weaponry. The muskets, with their intricate designs, were a blend of Lumbridge's practicality and Varrock's sophistication. Flintlocks became the choice for the Military police, their design sleek and efficient. Crossbows, with their precision, were favored by the lawmen.

Communication between Lumbridge and Varrock was of utmost importance. Carrier pigeons, with their uncanny ability to navigate, were used for sending messages. These birds, trained meticulously, would carry scrolls tied to their legs, ensuring that the two cities were always connected. For more urgent communication, especially during battles against the giants, smoke signals were used. These signals, with their distinct patterns, conveyed messages, from calling for reinforcements to signaling victory.

The bond between Lumbridge and Varrock, though forged in adversity, was strengthened by mutual respect and admiration. Each city, with its unique customs, traditions, and aesthetics, contributed to the rich tapestry of their shared world.

The Highway, a stretch of road connecting Lumbridge and Varrock, was both a marvel and a menace. Spanning vast distances, it was the only route that linked the two kingdoms, serving as a lifeline for trade, communication, and diplomacy. Its cobblestone path, worn by the countless feet and wheels that had traversed it, shimmered under the sun, a testament to its significance.

However, its importance was overshadowed by the peril it presented. The Highway's proximity to the territories of the Sasquatches and Yetis made it a treacherous journey. Tales of unsuspecting travelers ambushed by these creatures were common, their stories whispered in hushed tones in taverns and inns. The dense forests lining the road provided ample cover for these beasts, their roars often echoing in the distance, serving as a grim reminder of the dangers that lurked.

To mitigate the risks, both kingdoms had established fortified outposts, just 1.5KM from their respective gates. These outposts, manned by elite guards, served as the first line of defense against any potential threats. Towering watchtowers, equipped with advanced surveillance equipment, scanned the horizon for any signs of the Sasquatches and Yetis. At the first hint of danger, alarms would sound, alerting travelers and summoning reinforcements.

Yet, despite these precautions, the central expanse of The Highway remained largely unprotected. This stretch, often referred to as "The Gauntlet," was where the real danger lay. Travelers, be it merchants, diplomats, or adventurers, would often form caravans, their numbers providing some semblance of safety. They would journey through The Gauntlet during daylight, with scouts leading the way and guards flanking the sides, their weapons at the ready.

The Highway, with its blend of danger and opportunity, became a symbol of the resilience and determination of the people of Lumbridge and Varrock. Braving its challenges was seen as a rite of passage, and tales of daring escapades on this treacherous road became the stuff of legends. It was a testament to the indomitable spirit of humanity, their will to connect, trade, and thrive, even in the face of overwhelming odds.
